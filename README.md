# Pyro-thermal-kinetic
This repo contains matlab implementations of some commonly used algorithms in pyrolysis or gasification experiments.

Part of the codes and their modifications were used in papers:

  * [Kinetics and mechanism of CO2 gasification of coal catalyzed by Na2CO3, FeCO3 and Na2CO3â€“FeCO3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1743967119308207)

  * [Predicting kinetic triplets using a 1d convolutional neural network](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040603118304325)

  * [Characterization of Powder River Basin coal pyrolysis with cost-effective and environmentally-friendly composite Na-Fe catalysts in a thermogravimetric analyzer and a fixed-bed reactor](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S036031991830569X)

  * [Some Optional Methods of Activation Energy Determination on Pyrolysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0023158419020125)


Currently, functions are not well structured and organised. More descriptions and usage examples will be added .......
